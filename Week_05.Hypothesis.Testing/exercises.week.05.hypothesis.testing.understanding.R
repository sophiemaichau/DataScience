#### Hypothesis testing ####

# This week we will focus on a simpler dataset (chromosome 6)
# But we will only look at the european population
# Our variable of interest will be the minor allele frequency of all variable SNPs

# Our null hypothesis is: minor allele frequencies are the same everywhere on chromosome 6
# Our alternative hypothesis: some places have higher minor allele frequencies than expected (balancing selection)


# Load data and calculate maf

#### Using probability ####


# Q: What is the observed p20 = n20/n for the entire chromosome

# Q: So of 1000 random snps how many do you expect to have maf > 0.2 ?

#### Imagine three bins... ####

# Imagine you have a bin with 99 SNPs, 30 of them have maf > 0.2
# Imagine another bin, with 100 SNPS, 22 of them have maf > 0.2
# Imagine another bin, with 1000 SNPS, 220 of them have maf > 0.2
# You have estimated an expected frequency of SNPs with maf > 0.20 to be 
p20 = 0.18 # 18 % this is NOT what you have calculated for the chrosome

#### Use simulation to estimate the null distribution and the p value ####

# Use 1000000 simulations to estimate the p value for the observation (30 / 99)
# H0: The frequency of maf>0.20 snps in this sample is p20 
# HA: The frequency of maf>0.20 snps in this sample is HIGHER than p20
# So is 30/99 significantly higher than p20 when it is based on 100 snps only?

set.seed(1)
x = sample(x = c(0,1), size = 99, prob = c(1-p20,p20), replace = TRUE)
# ^^^
# Hint!
# This is one way of getting 0 and 1s with frequency 1-p20 and p20.

# Another way

# Now do 1 million simulations and plot and save make a histogram of your simulated number of snps with maf>0.20
# Add the estimated pvalue to the plot as title ( plot1 + ggtitle("Hello world") )
# Save the plot

# Do this for both simulation strategies hinted above
# Q: Is one of them faster? Why?

# Method 1

#### Using binomial simulations to estimate the null distribution and the p value ####

x >= n20

?rbinom

# Q: Use rbinom to simulate the first bin (33/99)  1 million times
# make a histogram of the number of snps in the bin with maf > 0.20 and add the estimated p value as title... and save it


# Compare the three different null distributions you have obtained.
# Q: How similar are the three different null distributions?

# Q: Select the method you like most from above and test all 3 bins using 1 million simulations

# In all cases we use the HA: 
# HA: The frequency of maf>0.20 snps in this sample is HIGHER than p20


# Compare the three results - what can you save about sample size and the null diributions?
# Q: What happens with increasing sample size? 

# Discuss : How many different null distributions exist?
# When we have different p20 and number of snps...

#
# 
#
# So instead of estimating p values from our own null distribution we
# may use a function that calculates the area under the curve...
#
#
#

#### Parametric test - use the binomial distribution as null distribution ####

n = 99
n20 = 30
x    = 1:n
y   = dbinom(x = x, size=n, prob=p20)
pd  = data.frame(x=x, y=y)
ggplot(pd, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_col(width = 0.5) + geom_vline(xintercept = n20, lty=2)

# Q: What is it we are calculating above?

# You can calculate the area under the curve as 
sum(dbinom(x = n20:n, size = n, prob=p20))

# Q: Is observing 3 out of 10 SNPs significant? (what is the pvalue?)


# Q: Why not? 3/10 >> p20 ?

# Q: What about 220/1000 ?

# Q: Does the test take sample size into account?

# Q: Also make a histogram using the binomial distribution of the 3 imagined bins
# Add dbinom calculated pvalues as titles


# Now you have seen 4 different ways of getting p values
# If you were to do the test for several thousand bins, which method would you use?

# Can you imagine cases were you would use another method?

# What are the downsides of taking a complex problem (distribution of maf) 
# and turning it into a simple problem (frequency of maf > 0.20) ?

# Next week we will test all bins on the chromosome
# And we will also try and use permutations to estimate the null distribution
